                            <p>As the volume of information available to science increases, adoption and development of new techniques for processing this data is essential. In order to better understand the opportunities machine learning could offer data-intensive researchers, we are running a 3-day workshop that will provide introductory sessions on data exploration, a diverse range of speakers from academia and industry and networking opportunities to meet with other data-intensive researchers and professionals. Our focus for the 3 days is exploring recent advances in machine learning from fields outside astronomy and develop a better understanding of where these techniques may be best applied in our research. We encourage participants with different backgrounds and levels of experience with machine learning as the workshop will offer sessions for novices through to advanced users.</p>

                                                    <td>The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to science has a distinguished history.  Recent progress in AI and laboratory automation has made possible the full automation of simple forms of scientific research. A Robot Scientist is a physically implemented robotic system that applies techniques from AI to execute cycles of automated scientific experimentation: hypothesis formation, selection of efficient experiments to discriminate between hypotheses, execution of experiments using laboratory automation equipment, and analysis of results. The motivation for Robot Scientists is to both to better understand science, and to make science more efficient. Our Robot Scientist ‘Adam’ was the first machine to autonomously discover novel scientific knowledge.  Our Robot Scientist  ‘Eve’ was originally designed to automate drug discovery, with a focus on neglected tropical diseases. In chess there is a continuum of ability from novices up to Grandmasters. We argue that this is true in science as well, from the simple research that Adam and Eve can do, up to an Einstein or Newton.  If this is true then it is likely that advances in AI and lab automation will drive the development of ever-smarter Robot Scientists. The Physics Nobel Frank Wilczek is on record as saying (10 years ago) that in 100 years’ time the best physicist will be a machine. If this comes to pass this will not only transform technology, but our understanding of science, and the Universe.
